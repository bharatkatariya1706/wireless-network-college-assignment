        <h2>Paatal Pani</h2>
        <p>
           The Patalpani Waterfall is a waterfall on the Choral River, a tributary of the Narmada, located in the Mhow Tehsil of Indore district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.
            <br>
         Patalpani is a waterfall in Madhya Pradesh. It has an approximate height of 91 m (300 ft). It is on the Choral River.

The water flow is highest immediately after the rainy season (usually after July). It goes almost dry in the summer season, and the stream is reduced to a trickle. The area around Patalpani is a popular picnic and trekking spot.

According to folklore, the pit (kund) at the bottom of the falls goes as deep as patal (the underworld in Indian mythology). Therefore, the falls are called Patal-pani, pani being the Hindi word for water.
        </p>
        <p>The nearest airport is Indore International Airport which is situated at a distance of roughly 40 km from the falls. The rest of the distance has to be covered via road or rail transport means. Dr. Ambedkar Nagar (MHOW) is the nearest town

The nearest railway station is Patalpani railway station near the falls at a distance of 200 m on the Dr. Ambedkar Nagar Railway Station (MHOW)-Sanawad metre gauge train line.[citation needed] Two trains run on these route, one being the Heritage Train from Dr. Ambedkar Nagar Railway Station (MHOW) till Kalakund and the local train between Dr. Ambedkar Nagar Railway Station (MHOW) and Sanawad.[citation needed]

The heritage train[1] offers views of the Ghats, the Valleys, the Choral River and the rail line itself which more than a century old. It returns back the same day to Dr. Ambedkar Nagar (MHOW) from Kalakund[2] in the evening.

To reach the waterfall via road, one has to first reach Dr. Ambedkar Nagar (MHOW) town in Indore District. From there, the waterfall is situated at a distance of 8 km on internal country roads.[citation needed]</p>
