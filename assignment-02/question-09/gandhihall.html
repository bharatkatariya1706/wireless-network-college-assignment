        <p>The Gandhi Hall is one of the architectural marvels that stands out as a testament to Indore’s glorious past and vibrant present. This magnificent building is known for its Indo-Gothic style and European architectural influence. It is also historically significant and was established in the 20th century, featuring intricate carvings, stained glass windows, and a majestic clock tower.  

If we look at the architecture of Mahatma Gandhi Town Hall Indore measures 112 feet in length, featuring a stage and a gallery which is surrounded by an open verandah with four corners of the building that meet the minarets or Rajput-style and is topped with domes and the entrance gate is from the southern part. 
The Hall is on a sprawling 4.25-acre campus with grounds, open-air theatre, public plazas for social, religious and cultural gatherings, parking spaces and a huge library. The Hall is also known for its huge green cover area. 

The Hall’s Indo-Gothic style is portrayed by the pointed arches, ribbed vaults and flying buttresses, which are made in typical Gothic style. However, the building also incorporates elements of the Indian style of architecture, making it a unique blend of the East and the West. 

If we look at the surroundings of the Gandhi Hall, the complex also features a park for children, a temple and a library. The ceilings of the Hall look remarkable. It is made of Paris white plaster and decorated with gold and palladian arches. The Gandhi Hall of Indore also consists of a terraced roof and ornamental mouldings, adding to the grandeur of the building. 

However, one of the main attractions of Gandhi Hall is its clock tower, which is placed at a height of ninety feet and capped by a larger dome housing the clock itself. The clock is over 100 years old and used to chime daily, playing a major role in Indore’s life and helping people in their activities. Still, sadly, the clock stopped chiming. 

Even though it’s a heritage site in Indore, it was considered a delicate structure, and due to lack of upkeep, the bell chiming was unsafe because the chiming vibrations contributed to deteriorating the building. According to the reports, an 83-year-old watchmaker, P.B. Lapalikar, who helped repair the clock in 1956 and in 2013, requested the authorities to allow him to fix the clock once again. 

Fascinatingly, the work was accomplished by him, his son and his grandson, and they managed to repair the clock within two weeks. They did some anchoring work out in the building to make it safe for the chiming bell. In July 2020, the people of Indore listened to a clock ringing every fifteen minutes. 

Like every city in India going through the smart city project, Indore also went through the “Smart City Indore” project in 2021, and this Hall was again renovated and restored. Today, the Gandhi Hall campus includes a 1200 sq. m. area of the interior Hall, marble flooring, a wooden stage, unique portraits on the wall and another interior with a wooden ceiling. </p>
