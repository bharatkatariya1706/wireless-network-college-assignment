        <h2>Ralamandal Wildlife sanctuary</h2>
        <p>
           The Ralamandal Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1989 in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. It is spread over five square kilometers and is home to different species of birds and other wildlife.[1][2] It has an ancient palace built by Holkar which was primarily used as a hunting hut also known as shikargah (hunting lodge).[3]
            <br>
            Long back, the place served as a hunting ground for the royal family members of Holkar as it had a huge population of tigers, leopards and deers.[4] In order to protect animals and birds from noise and air pollution emanating from nearby highway, a green wall of about 10,000 trees was created. It is 180 meters long and 6 meters wide.[5]

The majority of the Fauna includes Leopard, Black Buck, Sambar, Chital, Blue bull, Jarak, Bhedki (Barking deer) Rabbit etc. while Teak, Saja, Chandan, Eucalyptus, Babul, Bamboo etc. are among the popular available Flora.[6]

        <p>Spread over 5 sq. km, the sanctuary is home to different species of birds and other wildlife like Leopards, Black Bucks, Chitals, Blue bulls, Hyena, Barking deers, Peacock, Palm-civet, Porcupine and Hare. To protect animals and birds from noise and air pollution emanating from the nearby highway, a green wall of about 8,000 trees was created. There are several trails present in the Wildlife Sanctuary which are ideal for trekking, by both amateurs and professionals. There is also the facility of camel rides inside the sanctuary, which is one of the top highlights among the tourists.
