        <h2>Chhatribaug</h2>
        <p>
           Chhatri Bagh, located in Indore is a historically significant site that is closely connected with the Holkar dynasty. The garden was established as a burial site, a tribute to the memory of the Holkar rulers and other notable figures. 
It comprises numerous chhatris or cenotaphs, which serve as memorials for individuals of historical importance. These cenotaphs are perfect examples of Maratha-style architecture that features dome-shaped structures with tapered conical pyramids and intricately carved exteriors, making this site as one of the top places to visit in Indore.

The largest and most decorated cenotaph, specifically adorned with canvases, belongs to Malhar Rao Holkar I, the founder of the Holkar dynasty. Another prominent chhatri within the garden is dedicated to Queen Ahilyabai which is situated beside Bolia Sarkar’s Chhatri. These memorials are set on the banks of the Saraswati River, creating a mesmerizing setting, particularly in monsoon season, the best time to visit Chhatri Bagh Indore, when the garden breathes in the fresh rain and blooming flowers fill the atmosphere with its aroma.

Indore Chhatri Bagh in today’s day is not just a historical site but also a place for cultural events and festivities. The peaceful atmosphere of the garden is perfect for evening walks, and it changes into a vibrant venue during musical performances and festivals. Evenings at the Chhatri Bagh are particularly more charming, with the cenotaphs beautifully illuminated, enhancing their visual appeal.  Visitors can also enjoy the boat rides on the artificial lake within the park. Madhya Pradesh also included the chhatris in a walking tour of Indore’s historical sites in 2018 that highlights their cultural importance.
